# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to assist management by creating two tables focusing on retiring employees and who can replace them. Table one, which can be seen at  https://github.com/GiovanniBottone/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv , determined the number of retiring employees per title, while table two, which can be seen at https://github.com/GiovanniBottone/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/Membership_Eligibility.csv , focused on identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This information helped management prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many employees reach retirement age.

## Results

•	1/3rd of retiring employees are Senior Engineers, 64% of retiring employees are either Senior Engineers (33%) or Senior Staff (31%.)

•	The two most important positions to prioritize in the mentorship program are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff. 

•	Senior Engineers will be harder to replace than Senior Staff due to the fact that there are nearly three times as many Senior Staff employees (540 total, 35% of all eligible employees) eligible for the mentorship program as there are Senior Engineers (192 total, 12% of all eligible employees).

•	Due to the overwhelming amount of retiring employees (90,398 total), it is very likely that every eligible employee (1,549 total) is accepted into the membership program; however, this barely solves the vacant job issue considering only 1.7% (1,549/90,398) of positions newly vacant positions can be filled by the existing membership eligible employees. 


## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

The simplest way to identify how many roles need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact is to group the retiring employees together by age, assuming each employee retires at 65 this will allow of Pewlett Hackard to forecast yearly hiring goals to match the number of retiring employees. This it the perfect case scenario; however, a more likely approach is to identify the highest impact positions of the retirees and prioritize replacing them through the mentorship program. That is the more likely approach for of Pewlett Hackard considering the disparity of retiring employees vs mentorship eligible employees.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

Yes, there are only 1,549 eligible employees which accounts for 1.7% of the retiring employees. Pewlett Hackard has more retiring employees than mentorship eligible employees in every position, there is an abundance of qualified, retirement ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.

Additional Query that provides insight for Pewlett Hackard:

An additional query grouping the number of retiring employees by their retirement year and position would help Pewlett Hackard understand how quickly they need to hire new employees and begin their mentorship program training, as well as highlight positions of need.
